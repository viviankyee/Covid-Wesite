<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Orgins of the Coronavirus Disease </h1> 
<p style="font-size:145%;">  Coronavirus disease, abbreviated as COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019. There is evidence that suggests that the virus is descended from a coronavirus that infects wild bats. According to sources from China, the Coronavirus spikes in the area were most likely linked to the Hunan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sold live animals. It is believed that some of the animals purchased from the shop were infected with the coronavirus. By December of 2019, the number of coronavirus cases has gradually increased, which was mostly driven entirely by human-to-human interaction. During the early stages of the outbreak, the virus spread to other provinces of China largely due to the Chinese New Year migration. On the 30th of January, the coronavirus was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. COVID-19 has spread all over the world, and people are told to quarantine to reduce the spread of the coronavirus disease.  <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/tea/bubble-tea-taiwanese-street-drink-turned-american-addiction"> Click Here To learn More</a> </p>
